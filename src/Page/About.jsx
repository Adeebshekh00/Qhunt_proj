              </h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              Qhunt was founded by a group of passionate quiz enthusiasts who shared a common love for learning and trivia. It all began in a small coffee shop where these friends would gather every weekend to challenge each other with obscure facts and questions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
              Realizing the joy and camaraderie that quizzes brought into their lives, they envisioned creating a platform where people from all over the world could experience the same excitement. With a clear goal in mind, they combined their expertise in technology and education to develop Qhunt, an app that transforms learning into an enjoyable and social experience.
